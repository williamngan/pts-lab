# QuickDraw with Pts

This is a script to render a series of drawings from the [QuickDraw dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset)

1. (Optional) Download a `ndjson` file from the dataset and then create a subset. First try a smaller subset with 5 or 10 drawings, and save it as `json` file. [See instruction here].(https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset/blob/master/examples/nodejs/ndjson.md)

2. Run `npx serve .` to see the drawings.
